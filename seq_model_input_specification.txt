Rewards are the negative of the sum of the weighted mse from various boxscore stats:
    1.) complete boxscore
    2.) come up with weighted loss function that will provide the reward value

        - individual team total reb gets most weight
        - individual team total assist gets most weight
        - individual team total block gets most weight
        - individual team total steal gets most weight
        - individual team total turnover gets most weight

Use PPO as the algorithm, how to determine value function?

action potentials:
0 - 24: seconds expiring between plays
0 - 675: 26 actions for each player in the game model (26 x 26 = 676)
